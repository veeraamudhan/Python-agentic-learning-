# Python + Agentic AI Learning Journey

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in **Python programming** and **Agentic AI systems**.  
The goal is to build strong foundations in Python, explore AI agents, and develop projects that demonstrate real-world skills in autonomous systems and AI tooling.

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Strengthen Python fundamentals and practical coding skills  
- Understand and implement **agentic AI building blocks**:  
  - Reasoning & Planning  
  - Memory & Retrieval  
  - Tool integration  
  - Multi-agent orchestration  
- Build small projects weekly, gradually increasing in complexity  
- Create a **portfolio-ready collection of notebooks and demos**

💡 Notes & Best Practices

Each notebook contains code + explanations + markdown notes.

Mini-projects at the end of each week reinforce learning.

All AI agent experiments use LangChain, OpenAI API, and vector DBs where applicable.

Screenshots, demo GIFs, and results are added progressively.

🔗 Portfolio Goals

Show a consistent learning curve: Python → Agentic AI

Highlight hands-on projects and demos

Provide well-documented notebooks that are easy to follow
